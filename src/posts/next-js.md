## Introduction

NextJS is a popular framework built on top of React that offers numerous features for building production-ready applications.

## Features

- **File-based Routing:** Create routes by adding files to the `pages` directory.
- **Server-side Rendering (SSR):** Improved performance and SEO.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG):** Generate static pages at build time.
- **API Routes:** Build API endpoints as Node.js functions.

## Getting Started

To create a new NextJS project, use the following commands:

```bash
npx create-next-app my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

## Example

Create a simple page:

```
import React from 'react';

const Home = () => {
  return <h1>Hello, NextJS!</h1>;
};

export default Home;
```

Create a file `pages/index.js` and see the result at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Conclusion

NextJS extends React with powerful features that make it an excellent choice for production applications.
