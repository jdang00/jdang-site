After God preserved Noah and his family from The Flood, God declares a covenant between Himself and Noah and his descendants. Since we are descendants of Noah, we refer to this covenant as a perpetual or everlasting covenant. This is the first instance of the word "covenant" is used, along with the structural trappings that accompany it. However, it wasn't the first covenant -- that honor belongs to God's covenant with Adam.

## God Establishes the Covenant

_Genesis 9:1_:
God has declared to Noah that He is establishing His covenant. This legally binding agreement was made on the foundation of God's sovereignty. This is the most perfect type of formal agreement, as no one can destroy it, find a loophole in it, or abolish it.

This covenant was born from the heart of God -- it carries the weight of the responsibility and position of an all-powerful God.

## The Conditions

This covenant is an unilateral covenant: only God not only makes but bears the responsibility of the terms and conditions. Therefore, one can be sure that God will keep it. Here are the conditions that God states:

- This covenant will last as long the earth exists
- This covenant promises to never destroy or cut off humans like the Flood did again
- There won't be another flood that will destroy the whole earth again

## The Sign of the Covenant

God established the rainbow in order to be a sign of the established covenant. We still see rainbows even to this day, as God established the sign for Noah and all future generations to see.

Not only was the covenant for humans and animals, but also for the earth. Prior to the flood, the conditions to make a rainbow in the clouds did not exist. The Flood altered the earth in order to show the rainbow as a covenantal sign. (NOTE: This is a Brother Kent interpretation according to his study of creation and climate)

Even to this day, this promise has been perfectly fulfilled. God can never break a covenant or promise. This same God is upholding the covenant of our salvation, the only way in order to obtain eternal life.
