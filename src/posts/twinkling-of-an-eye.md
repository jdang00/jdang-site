What can we say about the second coming of Jesus? At the end of the ages, Christ and the Godhead will return to judge those who have sinned and manifest the salvation for those who have believed. The study of the end times is called eschatology.

## Timeline of events

The order of events that will happen at the end of time is often disputed. In terms of when the millennium of peace and prosperity will happen in relation to the second coming of Christ.

- Premillennialism
- Postmillennialism
- Amillennialism

There are so many views on eschatology because it is not clear. No one surely knows until it happens. For Christ’s first coming, no one got it right. Yet Christ fulfilled every prophecy perfectly. This makes eschatology a matter of secondary or eve tertiary importance in terms of fellowship.

## The facts

Even with the controversies, Christians must agree that a.) The Lord will come back in a literal physical form and b.) The Lord will bring those who He has predestined (The Doctrine of Election) to eternal life.

## Have we missed the second coming?

2 Thessalonians 2:3
Has the second coming already come? The folks in Thessalonica thought so. Paul warns in 2 Thessalonians to not be afraid by a spirit, spoken word, or a letter seeming to come from a so called “authority”. In essence Paul was warning against false teachers who had already said the second coming already arrived, or “at hand” (KJV). There are a series of things that are going to happen before the day of the Lord comes. Paul mentions the “rebellion” that will come first and the man of lawlessness (The Anti-Christ) will be revealed. This man will be the son of destruction and will be against every object of worship, even claiming to be God.
View: “Hyper Preterism”

Rather than being sad, depressed, and fearful of the second coming, we should not be afraid and rejoice because the Lord is in control. We must be faithful to Christ and His Word. It’s evident that the second coming hasn’t come yet, and it will be fairly obvious when it will.

## Those who are asleep

1 Thessalonians 4:13-18
"Fall asleep" refers to those who have passed away and are no longer walking with the living. Paul promises that those who are alive in Christ are going to be raised first before those who are died in Christ. A cry of command will come out retrieving all of God's elect. It also mentions "rapture" - "Then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord." This is the gathering and the first resurrection (according to Revelation 20). Paul says that for those who believe when Christ returns, we will be gathered up. For everyone else, destruction and ruin will come upon them.

For years, Brother Kent has been wrestling with a pre-tribulation rapture. He believes it simply does not see it in Scripture. The pre-trib rapture is based off of one verse in Revelation 3:10. Does this verse mean we will be taken out before the trials and period of tribulations? In Revelation 9:4, the bottomless pit is open and the locust-like scorpion tailed creature are tasked with tormenting humanity. But they will only attack those who do not have the seal of God on their forehead. He will mark believers supernaturally supporting the theory that God will “protect” us as opposed to remove us. Furthermore, we shall be transformed in the twinkling of an eye at the last trumpet, not the first one. This means that all the trumpets of judgment would already have been sounded.
